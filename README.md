# icebreaker++ RAM

The icebreaker is a friendly development board for the iCE40: [https://github.com/icebreaker-fpga/icebreaker](https://github.com/icebreaker-fpga/icebreaker)

## What is it

The icebreaker is a really nice and handy little board. But it has a small flaw, the ice40 FPGA it uses is quite smol, while it's often fun to see the exciting projects people pull off with 5k LUTs. Sometimes it's handy to have a bit of extra space available whe experimenting.

 - The board design takes the original designs and simply replaces the fpga with an ECP5.
 - The FTDI's second port is connected directly to extra I/O pins.
 - Each PMOD is connected to support 4x differential-pairs each.
 - Features footprints for both PSRAM and HyperRAM.
